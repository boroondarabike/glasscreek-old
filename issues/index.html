								<h2>Safety</h2>
								<p>From 2011 to 2017, 34 cyclists were injured in crashes throughout East Kew, Deepdene and Balwyn. Eight of these were classified as ‘serious’.</p>
								<p>At present, there is no separated on-road infrastructure in East Kew, Deepdene or Balwyn. This is a major barrier to encouraging commuter and utility cycling.</p>
								<p>The existing disjointed off-road paths are separated by busy four-lane 60km/h roads and have few crossing points. This strongly discourages school and recreational cycling</p>

								<h2>Connectivity</h2>
								<p>The existing Glass Creek Trail is disjointed and does not connect well to the wider network of bicycle infrastructure.</p>
								<p>The current path terminates in Hays Paddock in the north with limited signage and infrastructure to direct users onto the Koonung Creek Trail near Burke Road.</p>
								<p>To the south, the Trail comes to an abrupt end in Stradbroke Park at the intersection of Burke and Belmore Roads.</p>

								<h2>Infrastructure</h2>
								<p>Wayfinding along the route is non-existent.</p>
								<p>While much infrastructure is already in place, small connections between the isolated segments is required.</p>
								<p>Both on and off-road paths require infrastructure to encourage cycling.</p>
